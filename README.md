# papical-front-end
Front end for Papical, a social networking app that makes face to face connections simple. Check out https://github.com/cindychea/papical-back-end for the back end code.

With this app, users can set their availability and interests, and add their friends. They are also able to view their friends' availability and interests, and send invitations for a hangout accordingly.
This app is a work in progress. In future iterations, users will be able to import their calendars and export their confirmed hangouts. Users will also be able to create friend groups, and plan hangouts based on group availability. There will be an added feature, which will remind friends to book a hangout based on a timeframe set by users.
